\section{Processing manager}

\subsection{Instruction interpretation}

Results of the parser component are further analyzed in the processing component. Its most important capabilities are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Interpretation of CA instructions, which results in modifying the lexer state (moving back and forth in the input file).
	\item Substitution of variable symbols. After the substitution, the statement must be reparsed in the lexer and the parser, since the substitution may completely change its meaning.
	\item Interpretation of assembler instructions
	\item Ordinary symbols resolution
	\item MACRO and COPY expansion.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Expressions}
overview

they are parsed in grammar, later you give an expression "symbol evaluator" and it returns its value



\subsection{Data definition}
