\chapter{Functionality of extension}
The HLASM Language Support extension parses and analyzes all parts of a HLASM program. It resolves all ordinary symbols, variable symbols and checks the validity of most instructions. The extension supports conditional and unconditional branching and can define global and local variable symbols. It can also expand macros and COPY instructions.

\section{Highlighting}
The HLASM Language Support extension highlights statements with different colors for labels, instructions, operands, remarks and variables. Statements containing instructions that can have operands are highlighted differently to statements that do not expect operands. Code that is skipped by branching AIF, AGO or conditional assembly is not colored.

\section{Autocomplete}
Autocomplete is enabled for the instruction field. While typing, a list of instructions starting with the typed characters displays. Selecting an instruction from the list completes it and inserts the default operands. Variables and sequence symbols are also filled with a value from their scope.

\section{Go To Definition and Find All References}
The extension adds the functionality of \TT{go to definition} and \TT{find all references}. Use the \TT{go to definition} functionality to show definitions of variable symbols, ordinary symbols and macros, or open COPY files directly. Use the \TT{find all references} functionality to show all places where a symbol is used.
