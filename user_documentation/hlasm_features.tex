\chapter{Supported language features}
\label{LSPFeatures}
This part provides a brief overview of the parts of HLASM that are currently implemented.

\begin{description}
	\item [High-level interpretation] The library interprets high-level parts of the assembler. Following are the conditional assembly instructions for code generation and macro expansion:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item AIF
		\item AGO
		\item MACRO, MEND, MEXIT
		\item ACTR
		\item SETA, SETB, SETC
		\item ANOP
		\item LCLA, LCLB, LCLC
		\item GBLA, GBLB, GBLC
		\item AEJECT
		\item ASPACE
	\end{itemize}
	and assembler instructions for code layout determination:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item EQU 
		\item DC 
		\item DS 
		\item DSECT, CSECT, RSECT 
		\item LOCTR
	\end{itemize}
\end{description}

checking for all instructions, no support for AREAD, how is the user limited by current implementation
