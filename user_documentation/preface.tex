HLASM Language Support is an extension that supports the High Level Assembler language. It provides code completion, highlighting and navigation features, shows mistakes in the source, and lets you trace how the conditional assembly is evaluated with a modern debugging experience.

This extension is a part of the \href{https://github.com/eclipse/che-che4z}{Che4z} open-source project.
