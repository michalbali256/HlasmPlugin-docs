\section{Introduction}

HLASM Language Support is an extension that supports the High Level Assembler language. It provides code completion, highlighting and navigation features, shows mistakes in the source, and lets you trace how the conditional assembly is evaluated with a modern debugging experience.

In this document, we describe how to use the extension. We organize the document as follows: \cref{sec:start} covers the installation of the plugin and its configuration for basic usage. In \cref{sec:features}, we review all features of the extension from the user perspective. Finally, \cref{sec:configuration} contains full description of configuration necessary for using macro libraries and COPY members.
