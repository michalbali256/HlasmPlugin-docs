\chapter{Getting Started}

To start using the HLASM Language Support extension, follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Install the extension.
	\item In \textbf{File} - \textbf{Open Folder...}, select the folder where your HLASM project is located.
	\item Open your HLASM source code (no file extension is needed) or create a new file.
	\item If the extension fails to auto-detect HLASM language, set it manually in the bottom-right corner of the VS Code window.  
	\item The extension is now enabled on the opened file. If you have macro definitions in separate files or use the COPY instruction, proceed with the steps below to configure the extension to search for external files in the correct directories:
	\item After opening the HLASM file, two popups display. Select \TT{Create pgm\_conf.json with current program} and \TT{Create empty proc\_grps.json}. The two configuration files are created in the \emph{.hlasmplugin} subfolder.
	\item In the \emph{proc\_grps.json} file, fill the \emph{libs} array with paths to folders with macro definitions and COPY files. For example, if you have your macro files in the \emph{ASMMAC/} folder, type the string \emph{"ASMMAC"} into the libs array.
\end{enumerate}
